- Calvin and Hobbes: I do not have the rights to distribute the comics. I include the images here for historical purposes, but please don’t use them in your own projects!
- My MBTA API key. Please don’t spam it! I don’t use it any more and I was too lazy to remove it from the repo because it technically still works. If you download the project, please obtain your own API key from https://www.mbta.com/developers/v3-api.
